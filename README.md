Philosophy

    100% Pure Rust

    Zero telemetry, zero tracking

    Educational and extendable

    Mathematical clarity prioritized over raw performance

    Fully Open Source (MIT License)

Why?

Most modern machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) embed telemetry and hidden behaviors.

LinearAlgebra-WS is different ‚Äî it's completely open, simple, transparent, and under your full control.
No tracking. No hidden code. Just math.
